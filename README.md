			UC-1 Migration  (DATA ANALYST)
   

The first activity that I involve in this migration we have total 30 numbers of job plans available .We have to log in to the production environment which we got .
                              
			 Then we have to search each job plan on production environment over a search bar .When I search that 
I got the pipe line structure and the pipe line street having 10-20 modules available .



I have to open each module by right click source object and open then you have to go and see the process on the left pain click on processes and search for the .sql query use in the processing .

Then you have to open enter price gitHub link and search .sql query once you get the query and check the data has been change , updated , collapse function , rename , max function done .

We need to check weather that data has been transferring or not  identify it and maintain one excel sheet.

Where we have to perform :

1.	Job Plan 
2.	Sql. Query name
3.	Link of gitHub sql. Theory
4.	Server and username

And which table name and module are co-related that I have to note it down .
